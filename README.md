#ML

1. Implementations of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Kohonen Network model (Directories: MLP_NN, InitialKohonenNetwork) during the master studies course of Neural Network. Coding have been done in Java in a simple hierarchical flow and easy to understand. 
2. DL Project and MLP5L_pytorch directories contain the assignment/projects I implimented in python with pytorch for different purposes such as quantization etc.
